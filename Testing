Google Login:
We created a new google account to test our login method. Using incognito window and deleting the database, we can emulate a new user experience. One equivalency class I considered were users with profile pictures and users without. Our databse is set up so that a user's profile picture is taken from their Google account, so it was important to consider what to do when a user had no profile. It was also important to test how the page acted when a user was logging in for the first time versus when they are a returning user. A new user is redirected to a build profile page, so that they can complete their profile and enroll in classes. A returning user can only go to the build profile page if they want to update their profile.

File Uploading downloading:
I tested uploading different file types and tested uploading several times in a row. I also tested downloading these different files multiple times each to insure they behaved the same on subsequent downloads. The equivalence classes I considered were different types of files - I tested on image, text, and video files. I think these were good equivalence classes because they ended up behaving differently, showing that there was a real distinction between the classes.
